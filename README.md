# fancy_random_variables
My attempt to capture 'the point' with random variables... if you're trying to understand random variables then working through this code might help things click.

Essentially, they allow you to vary the underlying model easily and still answer all your questions - they're not REALLY supposed to be a computational tool like I've used them here... they're a mathematical formalism that allows you to treat each statistical experiment in the same manner. As a mathematician, once you've constructed your model and identified your sample space and relevant random variables for answering your questions... then you've solved the problem and the rest is for the computer! But it is pretty awesome to quickly code out and show the power of this idea.

Play around with the underlying model... develop your own model with the same syntax I've used here, and then ask some basic probabilistic questions! (Warning: I haven't rounded so there may be minor floating point errors present throughout i.e. 0.999999999... is probably 1.0 etc.)
